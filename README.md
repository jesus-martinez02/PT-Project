Repository containing the work done for the project in the course AH2173 Public Transport. Work done by Johanna Schaefer, Chloé Kemgne and Jesús Salvador Martínez Alcaide.

The repository contains:

- Python code for the project. The files koda_file_processing.py, api_connection.py, data_acquisiton.py and main.py deal with Data collection from KoDa and Data processing.
                               test.ipynb is a notebook that was used just for testing. The remaining notebooks are to perform the different analysis.

- QGIS and ArcGIS Pro files that were used to determine the percentage of ROW and display the average speed in maps.
  
- Tableau project which was used for data exploration and the analysis on specific segments.

- The raw dataset that was the result of the data collection process from KoDa but without any further processing (since data processing is performed within the Python code)
